# Contributing

- Keep issues small (<= 1â€“2 hours of work). Codex runs tasks in isolated sandboxes and opens PRs.
- Use conventional commits.
- CI (lint/typecheck/test) must pass before merge.

## Using Codex
- Create issues from `/docs/tasks/T*.md` and assign Codex, or @mention **@codex** on PRs for review.
